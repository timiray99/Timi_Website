                        <p>During my junior year of high school, I sought out additional learning opportunities by enrolling in computer science classes at a local community college. I took courses in <strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong> and <strong>Web Development</strong>, which were entirely self-taught. These classes were my first real introduction to coding and computer science, and it was during this time that I fell in love with the field. The challenge of learning new concepts independently, combined with the excitement of creating functional programs and websites, solidified my passion for technology and set me on the path I'm on today.</p>

                        <p>Since starting at Pomona College, I've taken an introductory computer science course in <strong>Python</strong>. Although I initially struggled with the class, it turned out to be a valuable experience that significantly improved my programming skills. Additionally, I completed a course in <strong>Functional Programming</strong> using </strong>Haskell</strong>, paired with <strong>Discrete Mathematics</strong>. These courses have not only deepened my understanding of computer science principles but have also broadened my programming expertise, setting a strong foundation for more advanced studies and projects. I am currently in the process of taking courses in <strong>Data Structures</strong> and <strong>Advanced Programming</strong> in <strong>Java</strong>, which are further enhancing my skills and preparing me for more complex programming challenges.</p>
